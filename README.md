## 🔍 **Python Tip: Chained Comparison Operators Simplified**

In Python, instead of writing separate comparison conditions with the same variable, you can **chain** them in one line. This feature makes your code **cleaner**, **more readable**, and **less error-prone**.

---

### ❓ What Are Chained Comparison Operators?

Rather than doing:
```python
if 10 < x and x < 20:
    print("x is between 10 and 20")
```

You can simply write:
```python
if 10 < x < 20:
    print("x is between 10 and 20")
```

🧠 Python evaluates it the same way, but it looks neater and is easier to read.

### ✅ Benefits of Chained Comparisons

1. **Improved Readability**  
   `10 < x < 20` clearly expresses that `x` lies between 10 and 20.

2. **Less Repetition**  
   You don’t need to repeat the variable (`x`) multiple times.

3. **Supports Multiple Conditions**  
   Python allows chaining more than two comparisons:
   ```python
   if 1 < x < 5 < y < 10:
       print("x is between 1 and 5, and y is between 5 and 10")
   ```

4. **Cleaner and Efficient Code**  
   Easier to write, read, and maintain—especially in complex conditions.

📌 *Chained comparisons are a simple yet powerful feature in Python that help you write smarter, cleaner code.*
